            &emsp;Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m SALMAAN MUSHTAQ, a passionate web
            developer based in Kashmir, India. With a keen eye for design and a
            love for crafting digital experiences, I thrive on turning
            innovative ideas into reality through the power of code.
            <br />
            &emsp; My journey ðŸš€ in web development began with a curiosity about
            how the web works, and it has since evolved into a dynamic skill set
            that spans HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJs, JQuery, Bootstrap, and
            Tailwindcss. <br /> &emsp;Ready to see what I can do? Explore my
            portfolio to witness the projects I&apos;ve brought to life, or feel
            free to reach out to discuss potential collaborations or
            opportunities. Let&apos;s create something amazing together!
